# The funding source you select is how you are charged for the order.
funding_sources = Tremendous::FundingSource.list
funding_source_id = funding_sources.first[:id]

# Optionally pass a unique external_id for each order create call
# to guarantee that your order is idempotent and not executed multiple times.
external_id = "[OPTIONAL_EXTERNAL_ID]"

# An array data representing the gifts you'd like to send.
order_data = {
  external_id: external_id,
  funding_source_id: funding_source_id,
  campaign_id: campaign_id,
  gifts: [
    {
