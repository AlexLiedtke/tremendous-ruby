# The funding source you select is how you are charged for the order.
funding_sources = Tremendous::FundingSource.list
funding_source_id = funding_sources.first[:id]


# Products define the set of reward options made available to your recipients
products = Tremendous::Product.list.map { |p| p[:id ] }

# Optionally pass a unique external_id for each order create call
# to guarantee that your order is idempotent and not executed multiple times.
external_id = "[OPTIONAL_EXTERNAL_ID]"

# An array data representing the rewards you'd like to send.
order_data = {
  external_id: external_id,
  payment: {
